    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>A little bit about me. I am a sophomore at The University of Oregon and I plan on studying accounting and maybe sneak in sports management as a minor, but we will see as time goes on. Before heading to Oregon I grew up in Los Angeles in a neighborhood names Silverlake. Although I do like it here in Oregon, nothing beats my hometown and I hope to move back there once I am done with school. I absolutely love sports and I think that is very apparent with the themes of this website. I've played and watched them from a young age and I hope to work within the industry someday. It could be coaching or maybe a management position or even doing accounting for a team.</p>
    
    <p>While I don't think I will continue with programing it has been very fun and challenging taking this class. I really had to stretch my brain with this class because I have never really done anything like this before so it was a really unique experience. I don't think I am a natural coder, but I do think I got a lot better throughout the term, but I was starting at a pretty low bar to begin with. I had a blast doing this class and it was a great experience.</p>
