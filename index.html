                <p>Ever since I was a little kid, I have loved sports. No matter the season, I was either playing or watching whatever sport was in action. One of the first sports I fell in love with was basketball. I was drawn to its fast pace and everything about the game. Fortunately, I grew up in a neighborhood that had a basketball league every year. I played in that league from the time I was five until I turned thirteen.</p>

                <p>As high school approached I knew I wanted to dedicate myself fully to basketball. I pushed myself harder than ever, and by the time high school ended, I had earned MVP honors in my league and led my school to its only two playoff wins in history.</p>

               

                <p> After highschool I wanted to start coaching. I started by volunteering as a coach at the same rec center where I grew up playing. That opportunity led to coaching at college hosted camps, and now, this summer, I'll be coaching a travel basketball team.</p>

        <h2>Golf</h2>

                <p>Growing up, I always remember visiting my grandparents' house and heading upstairs to my grandpa's office, where golf was always on TV. He had been an elite golfer, even qualifying for the U.S. Amateur, but due to severe scoliosis at a time when treatments were limited he couldn't continue playing competitively. Instead, he turned to teaching the game and even designed a golf course.</p>

                <p>He started teaching me golf when I was about five years old, taking me to a golf academy every day after school. But as time passed, other interests took over. I wanted to play more basketball, and as my grandpa's back pain worsened, he could no longer take me to practice.</p>

                <p>Right before I graduated high school, I felt the urge to pick up golf again. I started taking lessons, and before I knew it, I was hooked once more. Golf is a sport of endless pursuit, constantly motivating me to improve and strive for better.</p>

                <p>I'm always looking to learn more and improve my game. If you have any swing tips or want to check out the golf course my grandpa designed along with some of his swing notes, feel free to reach out!</p>

        <h2>Grandpa's Notes</h2>

            <div class="text-content">
                <p>My grandpa spent his whole life studying the game of golf and the swing of a club, and he left behind some of his notes on all-time great players swinging a club and what he saw with them. He also wrote a book that is on Amazon, but it's hard to find, so if you want to get a copy of that, please reach out, and my grandmother will hook you up with one.</p>
